flow_state Documentation
========================

**flow_state** is a lightweight Python utility for constructing compressible
flow states and reference conditions.

What is flow_state?
-------------------

``flow_state`` provides a simple, clean API for computing gas properties,
transport coefficients, and building complete flow state descriptions for
calorically perfect gases. It is designed for:

- Quick flow condition calculations for CFD pre-processing
- Generating consistent reference conditions
- Scripting and automation of aerodynamic analyses
